A random piece of chaos I made. Mostly just a mod containing whatever comes in mind for me.

There's also the unmaintained [JS version](https://github.com/SMOLKEYS/yellow) if you need it for some reason.

# Building (Desktop-only)

## Windows

1. Install [Java 17+ (Select either regular EXE installer or MSI installer)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) and Git/GH (Optional) through `winget install -e --id Git.Git`/`winget install -e --id GitHub.cli`.
2. Download the source code through GitHub or clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/SMOLKEYS/yellow-java` or `gh repo clone SMOLKEYS/yellow-java`.
3. Run `./gradlew jar` in the mod's root directory. This should download any needed dependencies and build a JAR file located in `build/libs`. Import it into the game.

## Linux

> <sub>The steps are practically the same for Windows, but you go with it differently. It's also assumed you know what you're doing since it's, well, Linux. But a step-by-step is still provided anyway.</sub>

1. Install [Java 17+ (Mindustry is run using Java, so you probably already have it installed)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) and Git/GH (Optional) through your package manager.
2. Download the source code through GitHub or clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/SMOLKEYS/yellow-java` or `gh repo clone SMOLKEYS/yellow-java`.
3. Run `./gradlew jar` in the mod's root directory. This should download any needed dependencies and build a JAR file located in `build/libs`. Import it into the game.

## Android

> <sub>Yes, you can build on Android. This also applies for most java mods out there.</sub>

1.  Install Termux through [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) or the [repositories releases section](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases). You're better off with the F-Droid one, as it automatically provides the correct APK for your device.
2. Run `pkg update && pkg upgrade` to upgrade necessary packages.
3. Install Java 17 through`pkg in openjdk-17` and Git/GH (Optional) through `pkg in git gh`.
4. Download the source code through GitHub or clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/SMOLKEYS/yellow-java` or `gh repo clone SMOLKEYS/yellow-java`.

> [!WARNING]
> Building the mod at this point is useless and not recommended, as you can't even import it into Mindustry. See what Warning 2 says below.

---

> [!TIP]
> **For Windows and Linux only.**
>
> You can use the `./gradlew copy` task, so it builds the mod and copies it to Mindustry's mods directory.

> [!WARNING]
> The output JAR provided by building the mod in any of the first 2 ways is NOT compatible with Android. See Multiplatform section just below.


# Building (Multiplatform)

> [!WARNING]
> Because of [limitations that Google applied to Android 14+](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/art/+/master/runtime/native/dalvik_system_DexFile.cc#380), **Mindustry v147 and beyond on such Android versions may fail loading Java mods entirely, depending on how OEMs implement said versions.**
>
> **This is something us modders nor Anuke can fix.**
> 
> "Google, fuck you."

> [!NOTE]
> It is more than recommended to see how it works by following the steps above for the PC-only jar.



Because Android's a piece of shit, this section has to exist.

If you already have the necessary tools, you can skip the steps here and run `./gradlew deploy`.

## Windows

1. Run `setup-windows.bat`. This will download all necessary stuff needed to compile for Android.
2. Restart the command line window you ran it on. If you ran it in an IDE, restart it, so it detects the changes.
3. Go back to the mod directory and run `.\gradlew deploy`. This should build a multiplatform JAR compatible for both Android and Desktop.

## Linux

`//TODO: I don't know how real Linux works. Android Linux sucks.`

## Android

> <sub>Yes, you can build the mod for Android in Android.</sub>

1.  Run `setup-android.sh` in the mod's root directory with `./setup-sdk.sh`. **This will only work in a Bash shell.**
  1.5. If it returns a permission denied error, `chmod 755 setup-sdk.sh` then run it again.
2. Restart Termux.
3. Go back to the mod directory and run `./gradlew deploy`. This should build a multiplatform JAR compatible for both Android and Desktop. By getting this far you should at least know how to import it.

---

> [!TIP]
> **For Windows and Linux**: If you have access to ADB, you can connect your Android device to your machine either through USB or Wi-Fi and run `./gradlew androidCopy`. This builds the mod and copies it to Mindustry's mod directory in the device.
>
> **For Android**: You can install ADB with `pkg in android-tools` and connect it to your device. Once you do that, you can use `./gradlew androidCopy` in Termux too!
>
> **Any**: Providing `-Padb.quickstart=true` and/or `-Padb.useBE=true` after `./gradlew androidCopy` works. `adb.quickstart` tells it to open Mindustry after building the mod and copying it. `adb.useBE` tells it to copy the mod to the Mindustry BE mods directory instead. Using both in tandem will build the mod, then open Mindustry BE after copying it.
>
> **NOTE: This only works if your device has Development settings enabled and either Wireless/USB debugging turned on.**
